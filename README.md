![image1](https://image.ibb.co/bLA0ES/Screenshot_from_2018_05_03_11_17_40.png)
## Getting Started 
This course is aimed at intermediate machine learning engineers, DevOps, technology architects and programmers who are interested in knowing more about deep learning, especially distributed deep learning, TensorFlow, Google Cloud and Keras. We are here to give you the skills to analyze large volumes of data in distributed ways for a production level system. After the course, you will be able to have a solid background in how to scale-out machine learning algorithms in general and deep learning in particular. 

We have designed the course to provide you with the right blend of hands-on, theory and best practices in this rapidly developing area while providing grounding in essential concepts which remain timeless.

 Tools and frameworks like, `Keras`, `TensorFlow`, and `Google Cloud` are used to showcase the strengths of various approaches, trade-offs and building blocks for creating real-world examples of distributed deep learning models.


### Prerequisites
This course is for intermediate machine learners like you who want to learn more about deep learning, how to scale out your deep learning model, and then quickly turn around and use the tools and techniques you are about to learn from this course to solve your tricky deep learning tasks. 

You will be successful in this course if you have a basic knowledge of computer programming especially Python programming language. Also some familiarity with deep learning like neural networks will be helpful. 

In this course, you will need a Google Cloud free tier account. Note that you won't be charged by creating the account. Instead, you can get `$300` credit to spend on Google Cloud Platform for 12 months and access to the Always Free tier to try participating products at no charge. By going through this course, you will probably need to spend at most `$50` out of your `$300` free credit.
